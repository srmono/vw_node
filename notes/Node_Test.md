# Node.js Express App with TDD and Real-Time Updates

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to creating a simple Node.js Express application for a To-Do list with real-time updates using Socket.io. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is employed to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Step 1: Initialize Your Project

```bash
# Create a new Node.js project
npm init -y

# Install necessary dependencies
npm install express socket.io --save
npm install jest supertest --save-dev
```

## Step 2: Create the Express App

Create an `app.js` file for your Express application:

```javascript
// app.js
// ... (refer to the code in the guide)
```

## Step 3: Write Test Cases

Create a `__tests__` directory and write test cases for the routes in the `app.test.js` file:

```javascript
// __tests__/app.test.js
// ... (refer to the code in the guide)
```

## Step 4: Run Tests

Run your tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Step 5: Implement the Features

Implement the features in `app.js` to make the tests pass. For example, implement the logic to retrieve and add tasks to a database and emit the 'newTask' event when a new task is added.

## Step 6: Test the Real-Time Functionality

Use a Socket.io client library to simulate real-time updates in your tests or create a separate test specifically for the real-time functionality. Consider using libraries like `socket.io-client` for this purpose.

Remember to follow the TDD cycle by writing failing tests, implementing the minimum code to make them pass, and then refactoring as needed.
